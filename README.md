# Definition of what an algorithm is and outlining the process in building an application

A programming algorithm is a step by step guide that a computer is required to follow to find a solution or meet a goal. There are many instances where algorithms are used, data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations all need algorithms.

1. Receiving a set of requirements from a client or coming up with your own set of requirements
2. Understanding what the requirements are
3. Choosing a software lifecycle methodology to follow
4. The design process can take place next
   - An algorithm would be created
   - Research of the application can be done
        
        Who the target audience are?
        
        Looking at existing solutions and see what improvements can be made
        
               
        
   - Brainstorm solutions to meet requirements
        
        The team can look at the aesthetics of the application
        
        How the user would interact with the application
        
        
   - Choose a solution that best fits the requirements 
5. Implementation of the application can take place
   - What programming language can be used?
   - What IDE will be used?
   - Start developing the application 
   - Based on the software lifecycle chosen a prototype will be created
6. Then some internal testing can be done
7. Buliding of the application will start
8. The team will then test & refine continuously until they are happy with the application 
9. They will then give the application to the client
7. Lastly, some maintenance can take place


# Give explanations of what procedural, object orientated and event driven paradigms are; their characteristics and the relationship between them.

**Procedural programming**

Procedural programming is a paradigm that is based upon the thought of procedure calls, this is when statements are structured into procedures, this can also be called sub routines or functions. 

This type of paradigm has predefined variables local variables, global variables, programming libraries.

Local variable: Variables can only be accessed in the specific block of code not the entire script of code

Global variable: Variable that can be seen throughout the entire program, this can be done by every other procedure taking place 

Programming libraires: Gives permission to the variable values to be pass through the program which will control it with a procedure


            srand(time(NULL));
            cout << "This is the first number: ";
            int randomNumber1(rand() % 10 + 1);
            cout << randomNumber1 << endl; 



**Object orientated**

This is a programming paradigm which is built around objects not actions and data rather than logic. A program which has a logical procedure receives input from data, processes it and produces output. 

Characteristics of object oriented programming:

Encapsulation : This is the idea of capturing data and storing it safely and securely from outside interfaces

Inheritance   : This is where a class can be derived from a base class, it has all the elements from a base class and some of its own 

Polymorphism  : This is the power to live in various forms. An operator can be overloaded to add two integer numbers and two floats

**Event driven programming**

Event driven programming is a paradigm which is subject to events like user actions, this could be mouse clicks or key presses. This paradigm is very useful GUI's and other applications such as games.
