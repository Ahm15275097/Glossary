# Definition of what an algorithm is and outlining the process in building an application

A programming algorithm is a step by step guide that a computer is required to follow to find a solution or meet a goal. There are many instances where algorithms are used, data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations all need algorithms.

1. Receiving a set of requirements from a client or coming up with your own set of requirements
2. Choosing a software lifecycle methodology to follow  
3. Understanding what the requirements are 
4. The design process can take place next
   - Define the solution
   - Some research can be done
   - Brainstorm solutions to meet requirements
   - Choose a solution that best fits the requirements 
5. Implementation of the application can take place
   - What programming language can be used?
   - What IDE will be used?
   - Start developing the application 
   - A prototype will be created
6. Then some testing can be done
7. Lastly, some maintenance can take place


# Give explanations of what procedural, object orientated and event driven paradigms are; their characteristics and the relationship between them.
