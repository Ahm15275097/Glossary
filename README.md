# Definition of what an algorithm is and outlining the process in building an application

A programming algorithm is a step by step guide that a computer is required to follow to find a solution or meet a goal. There are many instances where algorithms are used, data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations all need algorithms.

1. Receiving a set of requirements from a client or coming up with your own set of requirements
2. Understanding what the requirements are
3. Choosing a software lifecycle methodology to follow
4. The design process can take place next
   - An algorithm would be created
   - Some research can be done
   - Brainstorm solutions to meet requirements
        
        The team can look at the aesthetics of the application
        
        How the user would interact with the application
        
        
   - Choose a solution that best fits the requirements 
5. Implementation of the application can take place
   - What programming language can be used?
   - What IDE will be used?
   - Start developing the application 
   - Based on the software lifecycle chosen a prototype will be created
6. Then some internal testing can be done
7. Buliding of the application will start
8. The team will then test & refine continuously until they are happy with the application 
9. They will then give the application to the client
7. Lastly, some maintenance can take place


# Give explanations of what procedural, object orientated and event driven paradigms are; their characteristics and the relationship between them.
